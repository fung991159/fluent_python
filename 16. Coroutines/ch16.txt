starting from this chapter are the really tough stuff: coroutine, concurrency, metaprogramming. 
Who does love that? :p

1. coroutine is pretty much a generator, but use .send(datum) to feed the data into coroutine
2. in coroutine, "yield" is just for flow control, i.e. "stopping" the coroutine at "yield"
3. coroutine state can be get from inspect.getgeneratorstate()
4. "priming" a coroutine means advancing it to the first yield such that it is ready to use
as live coroutine
