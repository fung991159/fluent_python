a chapter on str vs bytes, as usual this is a bit too specific if one is not working with related topic.
The only take aways is "Unicode Sandwitch" in which Python code should convert byte to unicode as soon as possible,
and do the entire operation in string. Only when the work is done then convert it back to raw bytes.
