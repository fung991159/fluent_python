Concurrency, another fun and advance topic. This is actually more practical
    than "coroutine" in my opinion as it has a whole lot more use case
    , especially in dealing with data platform REST API.

1. concurrent.futures has ThreadPoolExcutor and ProcessPoolExecutor classes
    both have same interface that allows for easy switching between the two,
    what a brilliant example of "duck typing"
2. What exactly is a "Future"? Future class represent deferred computation that
    may or may not have been completed. It actually coorespond to "Promise" object
    in JavaScript. Hence an instance of Future can be queried in queues, about
    its state and their result when available.
3. instance of "Future" should not be created directly. Instead it should be
    created by scheduler such as "Executor" class.
4. Python code have no control over "GIL", only built-in function / extension
    written in C can release GIL while running time-consuming task. Hence
    each thread will release the GIL when waiting IO bounded result.
5. Executor.map() returns result in exactly the same order as called. Hence
    the code will run as fast as the slowest thread.
6. Executor.as_completed() return result as it is ready, regardless of the order
    submitted. It is more flexible than map().
7. lib "tqdm" is useful for producing progress bar over any iterable
8. It is a userful pattern to store each Futures instance with .submit() as Key in a dict,
    with dict Value as anything that could be useful later on in the code, could be error 
    handling.
9. concurrent.futures provided very high level interface for concurrent
    programming. But if required it is possible to add flexibilty
    using lower level module such as thread, lock etc.
